Russia is facing a “serious situation” as the coronavirus spreads, Moscow’s mayor told President Vladimir Putin, adding that \"the real number of those who are sick is much greater\" than official numbers indicate. Putin visited the hospital in Moscow's Kommunarka suburb where patients with coronavirus are being treated, wearing a special protective suit during the visit. He also took a moment to shake the hand of the hospital's head doctor. Moscow hospitals will receive up to 200,000 rubles ($2,500) per coronavirus patient from the city's health insurance fund to help cover the cost of their treatments. A 69-year-old woman suspected of being infected with coronavirus has died in Moscow's Infectious Diseases Hospital No. 1, the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper reported. She had been hospitalized after her daughter returned from Portugal. The Moscow health department later said she died from terminal cancer and tested negative for coronavirus. The republic of Chechnya has become the first Russian region to close all restaurants, cafes and \"crowded places\" after it registered its first three coronavirus infections, the region's leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced. He said some restaurants popular with tourists would be allowed to stay open. Aeroflot said it will reduce its flights to Vietnam, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Cuba starting March 28 due to the coronavirus. Volkswagen will suspend its car production in Russia over a supply shortage caused by the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, Volkswagen Group Rus said. Production will be stopped from March 30 to April 10 at its car plant in Kaluga and assembly line in Nizhny Novgorod.",

The Kremlin later said that Sobyanin's order does not apply to Putin, who is 67. Moscow announced it has finished converting a seventh hospital building to treat coronavirus patients. Sobyanin said the city has the capacity to more than double this count if needed. Moscow is changing the way it counts its coronavirus cases. Patients will now be considered positive upon a single positive test rather than having samples sent to a lab Novosibirsk, Siberia for further verification. The head of infectious diseases in the Stavropol region has been indicted after she returned to work with coronavirus symptoms after vacationing in Spain and later tested positive. The Kremlin said that medical assistance Russia was providing to Italy to help it battle the coronavirus was not part of an attempt to get Rome help lift EU sanctions on Moscow.",

He added that next week would be a nationwide paid holiday to encourage Russians to stay home and slow the spread of the virus. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced that libraries, theaters, recreational centers and nightclubs will be ordered to close in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus. “Half of the people who arrived [in Russia] from abroad passed through Moscow. A suitcase of viruses was brought from Courchevel,” Sobyanin said in a television interview, referring to a French ski resort. Russia has closed all sporting and cultural events and most large gatherings in an effort to halt the spread of coronavirus. Starting Thursday, Moscow residents aged 65 and older will be ordered to self-isolate at home. The Russian Embassy in the United States advised Russian citizens to return home due to the possibility that the U.S. could close all its airports to slow the spread of coronavirus there. The Russian government has told the country's regions to close nightclubs and cinemas to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Moscow health department said it will allow patients with mild cases of coronavirus to recover at home rather than in the hospital. Putin has ordered the Russian army to carry out drills designed to increase its readiness to fight the coronavirus if necessary, the Defense Ministry said.",

Russia's coronavirus situation could be resolved in less than three months, President Vladimir Putin told a meeting with members of the business community. Putin called for sanctions relief during the coronavirus pandemic, telling G20 leaders it was a matter \"of life and death.\" Russia will suspend all regular and charter flights to other countries starting March 27, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin ordered. All federal government employees will switch to remote work starting March 27, Mishustin's order said. Moscow will close all shops except for pharmacies and grocery stores, the city's mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. This measure, which also includes the closure of restaurants, cafes and bars, will last from March 28 until April 5, a period that President Vladimir Putin declared a paid holiday. St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov has ordered the city's restaurants, cafes, bars and non-essential shops to close for the same period. People will also be barred from visiting parks or religious buildings during this time. The popular southern Russian resort city of Sochi has asked Muscovites to stay away during the week-long nationwide holiday. Next week, Sberbank and VTB with backing from the Central Bank will launch a pilot business loan program that offers six-month, 0% interest loans to businesses to help them pay employee salaries during the coronavirus crisis. A staffer for the Russian government's chief of staff has tested positive for coronavirus, the Meduza news website reported. Russia has loosened its ban on foreigners entering the country to allow the spouses and immediate relatives of Russian citizens to enter. Russia's Rosatom is continuing the construction of nuclear stations abroad despite the global coronavirus outbreak, the state atomic agency's head Alexei Likhachev said.",

Sobyanin signed a law imposing fines on Muscovites found to be violating the city's self-isolation orders. Individuals will be fined up to 4,000 rubles ($50) for first-time offenses and up to 5,000 rubles ($63) for repeat offenses. Businesses will be fined up to 40,000 rubles ($500) for violating the order. Legal entities will be fined up to 300,000 rubles ($3,800) for first-time offenses and up to 500,000 rubles ($6,300) for repeat offenses. The United States purchased medical supplies from Russia to battle the deadly coronavirus outbreak in the country, the State Department said, contradicting the Kremlin's description of the shipment as humanitarian aid. Russia could close to the public or reschedule its annual parade in Red Square that commemorates the Soviet victory in World War II due to the coronavirus pandemic, the RBC news website reported. The Nizhny Novgorod region has launched a QR code pass system to allow residents to leave their homes for essential reasons. Moscow has announced it is developing a similar pass system for its 12 million residents but hasn't launched it yet. One of Moscow’s leading cancer hospitals, the Blokhin Cancer Center, has stopped admitting patients to chemotherapy sessions after one of the department's medics tested positive for coronavirus. All of the chemotherapy department's employees have been quarantined and its patients are under special supervision, the hospital said. Russia's state statistics service Rosstat has said it may postpone this year's census until 2021 due to the coronavirus.",

Russia's second-largest city St. Petersburg announced stay-at-home orders for their residents following Moscow's quarantine. Moscow's self-isolation order will be active through April 14, the city's coronavirus crisis center said. It later deleted the statement from its Telegram channel. In televised comments on state television, President Vladimir Putin said decisive measures by Russia had helped win it time in its battle to contain the coronavirus and to prevent an explosive growth in cases, but that it was vital authorities now used that time effectively. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin asked Russia's regional governors to consider imposing the same restrictions on movement to halt the spread of the coronavirus that have been imposed in Moscow, the state-run RIA news agency reported. The makeshift memorial to opposition politician Boris Nemtsov at the site near the Kremlin where he was gunned down in 2015 has been abandoned for the first time since his death due to Moscow's stay-at-home order, the activists who had maintained a 24/7 watch at the memorial said. Several regions of Russia have enacted region-wide stay-at-home orders for residents, following suit with Moscow's quarantine.",

    "body": "Putin signed legislation imposing severe punishment — including up to five years in prison — for people convicted of spreading false information about the coronavirus. The legislation also imposes punishments for people breaking coronavirus quarantine rules, including up to seven years in prison. Russia confirmed 440 new coronavirus infections, bringing the country’s official number of cases up to 2,777. Russia has earmarked almost $18 billion to battle the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told President Vladimir Putin during a televised video conference with his cabinet. Moscow authorities have developed a QR code system to allow residents to leave their homes as well as a smartphone app to monitor coronavirus patients’ movement in self-isolation, the city’s IT chief said Wednesday after tech experts raised privacy questions. President Vladimir Putin is now practicing social distancing with everyone and doesn't shake hands, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He has also started holding meetings remotely. A nurse at a police hospital in the Lipetsk region has potentially infected eight of her colleagues with the coronavirus after she returned to work with symptoms instead of self-isolating, the Kommersant business daily reported. Lipetsk region governor Igor Artamonov condemned what he said was \"criminal negligence\" in a statement. Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, the capital's main transport hub, has closed a third terminal due to reduced air traffic caused by the coronavirus, leaving three terminals open. Russia will extend its suspension of football matches in the face of the coronavirus pandemic until May 31, the Russian football association (RFS) said. Several regions of Russia have imposed limits on alcohol sales during their self-isolation regimes. Some cities in Siberia's republic of Sakha, including Yakutsk, have banned the sale of alcohol altogether. Russia's consumer protection watchdog has ordered quotas on the number of Russians being returned from abroad per day, the Kommersant business daily reported, a move that the Foreign Ministry said \"immediately complicated, and in some places paralyzed, the process of returning\" the approximately 35,000 Russians seeking to return.",

Three Russian Orthodox priests in Moscow have been hospitalized with coronavirus, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Two other priests are showing symptoms of the virus but their diagnosis hasn't been confirmed. It is \"unacceptable\" for Russia's regions to close their borders with other regions of the country, Mishustin said at a meeting with regional envoys after the republic of Chechnya sealed off its borders. The Kremlin also called such measures \"excessive\". Russia's health watchdog Rosdravnadzor has developed an \"express\" coronavirus test that can test at 94% accuracy within 40 minutes, the Industry and Trade Ministry said. Three regions of Russia — the Irkutsk region, Tomsk region and Krasnoyarsk region — have begun ordering all people arriving from Moscow and St. Petersburg to self-isolate for two weeks in a move to prevent the spread of coronavirus.",

The head of a top Russian research center told Putin that his lab was ready to start human trials of experimental coronavirus vaccines in June. Putin has asked health experts whether it would be possible to end Russia's paid \"non-working\" period sooner than planned. He originally declared a \"non-working\" week from March 28 to April 5, then extended the period until April 30. During the meeting, he added that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Russia hasn't passed yet. The head doctor at Moscow's Davydovsky hospital, Yelena Vasiliyeva, has tested positive for coronavirus, the Mash Telegram channel reported. Because she continued to work and attend conferences while waiting for the test results, more than 500 patients and doctors who were in contact with her are now self-quarantining and getting tested for the virus. Russia's largest business associations have called on the government to introduce a sweeping package of measures to support employers amid the coronavirus lockdown. In a letter to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, firms asked the government to cover two-thirds of employees' salaries for those who cannot work due to the shutdown. Russia has conducted more than 795,000 coronavirus tests so far, the federal consumer protection watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said.",

Putin has ordered the government to automatically renew documents for Russian citizens, including passports and driver's licenses, for as long as the coronavirus situation persists. Speaking at a televised conference, he also ordered the government to create a business support program within five days and said doctors will receive a monthly bonus while dealing with the pandemic. Moscow police will now be able to directly issue fines to residents who violate lockdown orders, according to an agreement between the Interior Ministry and the city government. Russia has now sent coronavirus test kits to more than 30 countries, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said at a meeting of the government's coronavirus task force. Russian Railways will reduce the number of Sapsan high-speed trains between Moscow and St. Petersburg to four per day in each direction amid reduced demand due to the coronavirus. The airport in Grozny, the capital of Russia's republic of Chechnya, will require all passengers arriving from Moscow to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test starting April 11. Moscow City Duma deputy Mikhail Timonov has reportedly tested positive for coronavirus. He had attended city council meetings as recently as April 1, when it voted to impose fines on Muscovites who violate lockdown orders.",

It added that an additional 24 hospitals will be converted to accommodate coronavirus patients, bringing the total number of beds to 21,000. Moscow has 13,002 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday. Moscow rejected 900,000 applications for digital lockdown passes in the passes' first day of operation due to residents entering incorrect or inaccurate information, the city's coronavirus response center said. The city issued 3.2 million passes for residents to leave their homes on Monday. Nine doctors at a hospital in the Moscow region have been infected with coronavirus, the RBC news website reported Tuesday. Doctors there had complained that the hospital doesn't isolate patients suspected of having coronavirus and that there's a shortage of personal protective equipment. A lack of aid for Moscow’s small and medium businesses hit by the coronavirus lockdown will lead to mass starvation and widespread protests, opposition lawmakers reportedly warned Mayor Sergei Sobyanin. A group of liberal Russian economists called on the government to send cash payments to the public in order to avoid an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, the RBC news website reported. Moscow traffic police will start checking all cars entering the city for digital lockdown passes starting Wednesday.",

Moscow, the epicenter of Russia’s coronavirus outbreak, will begin treating respiratory infections as Covid-19 as the disease shows no signs of slowing down, a senior city official has said. The Russian government has authorized hospitals to treat coronavirus patients with the untested Chinese malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which studies have linked to deadly side effects. Russian national carrier Aeroflot has closed ticket sales for all international flights until Aug. 1, the Kommersant business daily reported. About half of Russia's coronavirus cases are asymptomatic, the head of consumer protection watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said. Saint-Petersburg can expect to see anywhere from 40,000 to 120,000 coronavirus cases by June depending on how closely residents follow lockdown orders, Alexei Borovkov, a member of the city's coronavirus task force, has said. The city has 1,507 confirmed cases so far. Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry has advised against wearing face masks for regular trips outside, recommending their use only in crowded places, on public transport or when caring for a sick person.",

The Russian military will quarantine everyone involved in rehearsals for Russia’s postponed Victory Day Parade, the Defense Ministry said following reports that some participants have tested positive for the coronavirus. Around 500 demonstrators gathered in the southern Russian city of Vladikavkaz to protest against job losses and lack of information about the coronavirus outbreak, the MBKh News website reported Monday. Russians should stop coming to Crimea during the coronavirus pandemic, its Moscow-backed leader said Monday after a surge in traffic to the annexed peninsula this weekend. Russia has extended visas and other temporary residence permits for foreigners from March 15 to June 15 during the coronavirus pandemic that has shut national borders around the world. Putin’s act bans authorities from canceling visas and work permits, as well as from deporting and denying people refugee and temporary asylum status until June 15. Russia says it has so far carried out over 2 million tests nationwide. Authorities in Moscow are investigating the death of a woman on a bench outside her home on the day she was discharged after testing negative for the coronavirus. Dozens of patients and staff have been infected with the coronavirus at a psychiatric hospital in Russia’s northwestern Arkhangelsk region. More than half of 149 overall Covid-19 cases in central Russia’s Sverdlovsk region are concentrated in one hospital in the regional capital of Yekaterinburg, governor Yevgeny Kuyvashev said. City hospital No. 1 was placed under quarantine after 78 of its doctors and patients tested positive for the virus, Kuyvashev said on social media. Most of them are asymptomatic, he added, while one patient is in critical condition.",

Russia has now surpassed China to become the world's ninth most-affected country amid the pandemic. Russia's coronavirus lockdown measures may be gradually lightened as soon as May 12 depending on how well people comply with the measures until then, the head of the federal consumer protection watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said. Russian doctors mistrustful of official coronavirus data have launched an unofficial list of their colleagues who have died from the virus. The republic of Karelia in northern Russia will create an interactive map of the places where confirmed coronavirus patients in the region live, including their street names and house numbers, in order for the region's residents to avoid these places, its head Artur Parfenchikov wrote. The Immortal Regiment, an annual tradition in which millions of people in Russia parade with portraits of relatives who fought in World War II, will take place in an online video broadcast this year as the coronavirus has canceled Victory Day events. The head of a Siberian hospital repurposed for coronavirus patients is in critical condition after she fell from the hospital building following a conference call with health officials, local media reported Saturday. President Vladimir Putin is not waiting out the coronavirus pandemic in a bunker, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Nizhny Novgorod region will ban entry into the region unless one has an emergency work permit or proof of residence there, its governor said. The region has Russia's fourth-highest number of coronavirus cases, after Moscow, the Moscow region and St. Petersburg. Nearly 50 employees at the Mariinsky Hospital in St. Petersburg have tested positive for coronavirus, the local Fontanka.ru news website reported. Starting Monday, the hospital will only treat patients with coronavirus, with all other patients transferred to other hospitals. At least 874 Russian troops tested positive for Covid-19 between March and April 26, 19 of whom are in critical or serious condition, the Defense Ministry said.",

Twenty-seven of Russia's 85 regions are ready to start gradually easing coronavirus restrictions, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said. President Vladimir Putin said the coronavirus situation in Dagestan required urgent attention after a top official said hundreds of people in the region might have died from the virus. Russia's consumer protection watchdog Rospotrebnadzor has recommended that Russian airlines fill their flights by no more than 50% in order to adequately space passengers apart from each other. Russia's low coronavirus death toll compared to other countries is a result of the population's herd immunity, the head of Russia's Gamalei Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology Alexander Gintsburg said.",

Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has resumed his official duties nearly three weeks after first announcing that he had been diagnosed with the coronavirus and naming an acting prime minister. The Saratov region has reinstated its ban on walks and outdoor activities a week after easing the restriction due to the region's high growth rate in new coronavirus cases, its vice governor said. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the situation with the coronavirus in Moscow is “still far from ideal.” Government offices in Moscow will reopen next week, and some clinics will be allowed to provide planned medical treatments. Sobyanin said that it was still too soon to think about reopening other parts of the capital such as shopping centres or hairdressers. Moscow authorities announced plans to double testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. Moscow residents will be allowed to go outside to walk or exercise only when the number of new daily infections reaches the \"tens or hundreds, not thousands,\" Sobyanin added. Moscow reported 3,545 new cases Tuesday. Russia's second-largest city St. Petersburg has banned residents from attending funeral services regardless of the cause of death of the deceased, the Fontanka.ru news website reported.",

They had so much freedom that it had spoiled them, and they did nothing but sit around croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a government that could entertain them with the pomp and display of royalty, and rule them in a way to make them know they were being ruled. No milk and water government for them, they declared. So they sent a petition to Jupiter asking for a king. Jupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures they were, but to keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The Frogs hid themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking the new king to be some fearful giant. But they soon discovered how tame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time the younger Frogs were using him for a diving platform, while the older Frogs made him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to Jupiter about the government. To teach the Frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent a Crane to be king of Frogland. The Crane proved to be a very different sort of king from old King Log. He gobbled up the poor Frogs right and left and they soon saw what fools they had been. In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant before they should all be destroyed. \"How now!\" cried Jupiter \"Are you not yet content? You have what you asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for your misfortunes.\" Be sure you can better your condition before you seek to change.",

    "body": "A Shepherd Boy tended his master's Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe.. One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, \"Wolf! Wolf!\" As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, \"Wolf! Wolf!\" Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep. In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting \"Wolf! Wolf!\" But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. \"He cannot fool us again,\" they said. The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest. Liars are not believed even when they speak the truth.",

So with much rustling of feathers and a fierce air, he came down swiftly on the back of a large Ram. But when he tried to rise again he found that he could not get away, for his claws were tangled in the wool. And so far was he from carrying away the Ram, that the Ram hardly noticed he was there. The Shepherd saw the fluttering Jackdaw and at once guessed what had happened. Running up, he caught the bird and clipped its wings. That evening he gave the Jackdaw to his children. \"What a funny bird this is!\" they said laughing, \"what do you call it, father?\" \"That is a Jackdaw, my children.

So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone. He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf! The Kid knew there was little hope for him. \"Please, Mr. Wolf,\" he said trembling, \"I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.\" The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily. Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade. Do not let anything turn you from your purpose.",

The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know. Next year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs. In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap. There none would dare harm them. But the Beetle buzzed about Jupiter's head, and made him rise to drive her away; and the eggs rolled from his lap. Now the Beetle told the reason for her action, and Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause. And they say that ever after, while the Eagle's eggs lie in the nest in spring, the Beetle still sleeps in the ground. For so Jupiter commanded. Even the weakest may find means to avenge a wrong.",

Before he composed himself to rest, he flapped his wings three times and crowed loudly.

But he had a queer, fluttery feeling inside him, for, you know, he was very much afraid of the Fox. \"Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever. Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embrace you! Do come down, dear friend, and let us celebrate the joyful event.\" \"How grand!\" said the Cock. \"I certainly am delighted at the news.\" But he spoke in an absent way, and stretching up on tiptoes, seemed to be looking at something afar off. \"What is it you see?\" asked the Fox a little anxiously. \"Why, it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way. They must have heard the good news and—\" But the Fox did not wait to hear more. Off he started on a run. \"Wait,\" cried the Cock. \"Why do you run? The Dogs are friends of yours now!\" \"Yes,\" answered the Fox. \"But they might not have heard the news. Besides, I have a very important errand that I had almost forgotten about.\" The Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep, for he had succeeded in outwitting a very crafty enemy.

The Russian National Guard said it is using drones and a helicopter to enforce self-isolation rules in Moscow and the Moscow region over the May holidays. The drones and helicopter will send information about violations to officers on the ground, who will then issue fines to violators.",

A baby was born with the coronavirus in Russia's Caucasus region of North Ossetia, health officials were quoted by the state-run TASS news agency as saying Sunday, to a mother who is also infected. The birth in the city of Beslan follows one in mid-April in Peru, which health officials there said was the second known case of a Covid-19 positive newborn worldwide. The growth of new cases in Russia is stabilizing, Anna Popova, the head of public health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said Sunday, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third day this week. “We’ve moved towards the level of stability that we’ve all been waiting for .. I would say that as of today, we have halted the growth,” she told the state television channel Rossiya 1. More than 13,000 people in Dagestan have contracted the coronavirus or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the region’s health minister said Sunday. A total of 657 people have died from Covid-19 or CAP, including 40 doctors, he added. According to official statistics, there have been 3,371 coronavirus infections and just 29 deaths from Covid-19 in the region. Russia confirmed 9,709 new coronavirus infections Sunday, bringing the country’s official number of cases to 281,752.",

The man who had found the purse fell into a panic. \"We are lost if they find the purse on us,\" he cried. \"No, no,\" replied the other, \"You would not say 'we' before, so now stick to your 'I'. Say 'I am lost.'\" We cannot expect any one to share our misfortunes unless we are willing to share our good fortune also.",

One day when the quarreling had been much more violent than usual and each of the Sons was moping in a surly manner, he asked one of them to bring him a bundle of sticks. Then handing the bundle to each of his Sons in turn he told them to try to break it. But although each one tried his best, none was able to do so. The Father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his Sons to break one by one. This they did very easily. \"My Sons,\" said the Father, \"do you not see how certain it is that if you agree with each other and help each other, it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you?

Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself.\" And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon moved very readily, and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned.

So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of. At nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably. With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, he said very politely: \"A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends.\" \"I feel highly flattered, kind sir,\" replied the Cock slyly. \"If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in.\" The hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him. Those who try to deceive may expect to be paid in their own coin.",

They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited. After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along. One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble. \"We can help you to see the world,\" said the Ducks. \"Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry.\" The Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds. Just then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried: \"This must surely be the King of Tortoises!\" \"Why certainly—\" began the Tortoise. But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock. Foolish curiosity and vanity often lead to misfortune.",

He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose for a meal, should be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate. So he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his domains within twenty-four hours. The command struck terror among the beasts. All those who were so unfortunate as to have horns, began to pack up and move out. Even the Hare, who, as you know, has no horns and so had nothing to fear, passed a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about the fearful Lion. And when he came out of the warren in the early morning sunshine, and there saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears, a terrible fright seized him. \"Goodby, neighbor Cricket,\" he called. \"I'm off. He will certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say.\" Do not give your enemies the slightest reason to attack your reputation. Your enemies will seize any excuse to attack you.",

What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak. \"No need to search any farther,\" thought sly Master Fox. \"Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast.\" Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, \"Good-morning, beautiful creature!\" The Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting. \"What a charming creature she is!\" said the Fox. \"How her feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds.\" Listening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and also her breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth. \"Thank you,\" said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off. \"Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?\" The flatterer lives at the expense of those who will listen to him.",

I'll run you a race and prove it.\" The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off. The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up. The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time. The race is not always to the swift.",

I can promise you a good time if you do.\" The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help. The Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner. Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.",

The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite. For dinner the Fox served soup. But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his bill. Not a drop of soup could he get. But the Fox lapped it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork, made a great show of enjoyment. The hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage. Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly: Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.",

Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird \"hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo\" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat. Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window. \"Get away from here, sir,\" she said to the Grasshopper. \"Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!\" But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune. The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him. \"Well sir,\" she said, \"if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself.\" The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up. Flattery is not a proof of true admiration. Do not let flattery throw you off your guard against an enemy.",
